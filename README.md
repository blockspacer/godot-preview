[Godot 3.1](https://godotengine.org/)
or later.**

## Usage

When run *outside of the editor*, frames will be rendered and saved to
PNG images in the `out/` directory located in the project data directory.
These can be combined into a video using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
by running the following command while in the `out/` directory:

```bash
ffmpeg -r 60 -f image2 -s 2560x1440 -i %d.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 15 video.mp4
```

```bash
ffmpeg -i %d.png video.mp4
```

## Visual diff

```
npm install --global reg-cli
reg-cli.cmd .\out\ .\expected\ .\diff\ -R report.html -J report.json
```
